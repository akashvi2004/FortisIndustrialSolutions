      <h1>Polishing & Surface Coating</h1>

      <section class="polishing">
        <p>Fortis Industrial Solutions offers professional surface treatment services including mechanical polishing, electropolishing, and specialized coatings. These processes ensure compliance with industry-specific standards and prepare surfaces for high-purity, sanitary, and corrosion-resistant applications.</p>

        <h2>Mechanical Polishing</h2>
        <p>We apply progressive grit polishing techniques to achieve smooth, clean finishes. Internal surfaces are polished to specific RA (roughness average) values based on your specifications, ensuring optimal cleanliness and product flow.</p>
        <p>Mechanical polishing is especially effective for tanks, piping systems, and other components where fluid dynamics and surface hygiene are essential. Our process minimizes contamination risk and prepares surfaces for further finishing or direct use in clean environments.</p>

        <h2>Electropolishing</h2>
        <p>This electrochemical process enhances the corrosion resistance and aesthetics of stainless steel. It smooths surface peaks and removes embedded particles, creating a bright, passivation-ready finish ideal for hygienic and pharmaceutical environments.</p>
        <p>Electropolishing also improves the chromium-to-iron ratio at the surface, which supports long-term oxidation resistance and makes cleaning easier and more effective in service.</p>

        <h2>Surface Coating Options</h2>
        <p>We offer a range of protective coatings designed for demanding industrial applications. These include Teflon, epoxy, and polyurethane coatings for chemical resistance, thermal protection, and extended product lifecycle.</p>
        <p>Each coating is carefully selected based on operating environment, chemical exposure, and required physical properties. Coatings are applied in controlled conditions to ensure adhesion, thickness uniformity, and durability.</p>

        <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>RA meter verification of surface finish</li>
          <li>Visual inspection and final acceptance checks</li>
          <li>Documentation available for each treatment phase</li>
          <li>Coating thickness measurements and adhesion tests</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Our polishing and coating services are used in food processing, pharmaceuticals, clean-in-place (CIP) systems, chemical handling equipment, and biotech manufacturing components. Whether you need ultra-smooth surfaces for sanitary transport or corrosion barriers for aggressive environments, we deliver finishes you can trust.</p>

        <p>Every surface we polish or coat at Fortis Industrial Solutions is handled with precision to ensure compliance, performance, and long-term durability across critical applications.</p>
