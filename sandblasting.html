      <h1>Sandblasting / Glass Beading Services</h1>
      <p>Sandblasting and glass beading are powerful surface preparation techniques used to clean, smooth, and prepare stainless steel and other metal surfaces. These methods effectively remove contaminants, rust, and old coatings, providing a clean, smooth surface ready for further treatment, whether it’s for passivation, painting, or other finishing processes. At Fortis Industrial Solutions, we offer both traditional and mobile sandblasting services to ensure your equipment and components are prepared efficiently, no matter the location.</p>
