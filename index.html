<!--At *Fortis Industrial Solutions*, we work exclusively with high-quality materials to ensure durability, performance, and compliance with industry standards:

* *304 Stainless Steel* – The most widely used stainless steel, offering excellent corrosion resistance, strength, and formability. Ideal for tanks, piping, and general process equipment.
* *316 & 316L Stainless Steel* – Known for superior resistance to chemicals, chlorides, and acidic environments. The low-carbon version (316L) minimizes carbide precipitation, making it perfect for welded assemblies and sanitary applications.
* *Specialty Alloys* – For demanding projects that require enhanced strength, heat resistance, or corrosion protection beyond standard grades. We source and fabricate with alloys tailored to your process needs.
* *Food-Grade & Pharmaceutical-Grade Materials* – All materials are carefully selected and finished to meet strict hygiene, safety, and regulatory requirements, ensuring compliance with FDA, USDA, and GMP standards.

Our commitment is to provide materials that meet both functional and regulatory expectations, supporting safe and reliable operations across the food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and industrial sectors.-->
